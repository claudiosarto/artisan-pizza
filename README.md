# Artisan Pizza

Artisan pizza is a place where Pizza Chef prepare your favorite original Italian pizza, using the most delicious ingredients. 

This ordering system app will help the users selecting from a pizza menu or customize a pizza. 
The goal for the owner is to have access to the menu via Google Sheet as well as see all the orders placed there on a simple and intuitive GUI.
